## Quick Start

Before you start, you need the following:
- Node.js and npm installed
- A Cloudflare account
- Wrangler installed

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Cloudflare Account**: Sign up for a Cloudflare account at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
3. **Wrangler**: Install Wrangler, the Cloudflare Workers CLI tool, by running:
   ```sh
   npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
   ```

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Endriur24/PineappleGallery.git
   cd PineappleGallery
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a D1 database:
   ```sh
   wrangler d1 create "pineapplegallery-database"
   ```
   Paste the results, which look like this, into `wrangler.toml` (keep the binding name the same = "DB"):
   ```toml
   [[d1_databases]]
   binding = "DB"
   database_name = "pineapplegallery-database"
   database_id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```

4. Create an R2 bucket:
   ```sh
   wrangler r2 bucket create "pineapplegallery-bucket"
   ```
   Update `wrangler.toml` according to the response, but keep the binding name the same as below ("R2"):
   ```toml
   [[r2_buckets]]
   binding = "R2"
   bucket_name = "pineapplegallery-bucket"
   ```

5. Create KV namespace for cache functionality
   ```sh
   wrangler kv namespace create CACHE_KV
   ```
   Update `wrangler.toml` according to the response, but keep the binding name the same as below:

   ```toml
   [[kv_namespaces]]
   binding = "CACHE_KV"
   id = "42ee21cd50bf44adb285c6c3d02727cd"   #paste your own id
   ```


### Development
Start the development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```

### Deployment
Deploy the application:
```sh
npm run deploy
```
## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables need to be set:
- `USERNAME` - Admin panel username
- `PASSWORD` - Admin panel password

### Routing Configuration
The gallery can be mounted on any path by adjusting `index.jsx`:

1. Default configuration (at `/gallery/`):
```javascript
app.use('/gallery', appendTrailingSlash())
app.route('/gallery/', gallery);
```

2. Root path configuration (at `/`):
```javascript
app.route('/', gallery);
```

Remember to adjust `cachePurge.js` according to your chosen path.
